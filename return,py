What if we want to purchase two mobiles and return one of them? Which will be returned? Also, can we be sure that purchase_shoe() 
won't accidentally modify the global value for mobile?



total_price_mobile = 0
total_price_shoe = 0
def purchase_mobile(price,brand):
    global total_price_mobile
    if brand == "Apple":
        discount = 10
    else:
        discount = 5
    total_price_mobile = price - price * discount / 100
    print("Total price for Mobile is "+str(total_price_mobile))

def purchase_shoe(price,material):
    global total_price_shoe
    if material == "leather":
        tax = 5
    else:
        tax = 2
    total_price_shoe = price + price * tax / 100
    print("Total price for Shoe is "+str(total_price_shoe))

def return_mobile():
    print("Refund price for Mobile is ",total_price_mobile)

def return_shoe():
    print("Refund price for Shoe is ",total_price_shoe)

purchase_mobile(20000,"Apple")
return_mobile()
purchase_shoe(200,"leather")
purchase_mobile(2000,"Samsung")
